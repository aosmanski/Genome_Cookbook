A few more commands weâ€™ll need to know: 

``cd`` this is short for *change directories*. This is how you move around in the terminal.

``pwd`` this is short for *print working directory*. This is how you find out your current location in the directory structure

``cat`` this is short for *concatenate*, which simply means "to link together"


Let's get started using your computer's terminal
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Open your terminal window from the taskbar (or by going to Applications > Utilities > Terminal)

.. figure:: ../source/media/terminal_icon.png
    :alt: Terminal icon


    

You should see a window pop up that looks like this:

.. figure:: ../source/media/terminal.png
    :alt: Terminal

    

Click inside the terminal and enter the following commands:

.. code-block:: bash

    cd Desktop/Genome_Cookbook

    ls
